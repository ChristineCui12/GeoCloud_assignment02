/*
  Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs.

  Metric: accessibility_metric = num_bus_stops_accessible / total_bus_stops (ratio)
  where wheelchair_boarding = 1 means accessible, 2 means not accessible, 0 means unknown.
  We count stops with wheelchair_boarding = 1 as accessible.
  Stops with wheelchair_boarding = 2 are inaccessible.
  Stops with wheelchair_boarding = 0 are treated as neither (excluded from ratio denominator).

  Final metric is the ratio of accessible stops to (accessible + inaccessible) stops.
  Neighborhoods with no stops are excluded.
